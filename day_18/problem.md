## 🧩 Problem: *Prime Number Verification for Secure Access*

In a cybersecurity training lab, a system uses **prime numbers as security keys**. Before granting access, the system must verify whether a given number is prime.

You are assigned to write a program that performs this validation.

A number is considered **prime** if:

* It is greater than 1
* It has **exactly two distinct divisors**: `1` and itself

---

### ✔️ Input

One integer:

```
num
```

---

### ✔️ Output

Print:

* `Prime number` → if the number is prime
* `Not a prime number` → if the number is not prime
